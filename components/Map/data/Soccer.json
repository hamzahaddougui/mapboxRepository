Ray Greene Sr. (1892-1964), who served continuously from 1934 to 1962. A pharmacist who lived in Brentwood and operated the Brentwood Pharmacy, he said that his greatest satisfaction from public service was his work to prevent juvenile delinquency. An off-road bicycle course was built at the park in the early 1980â€™s, a major renovation completed in 1999, and a 2004 renovation includes two new soccer fields, two restroom/concession buildings, and two basketball courts, along with road paving, landscaping, and parking for 257 cars. Completed in 2007 is the addition of a restroom building that services the tennis courts and the playgrounds area.\n\nhttp://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=258","Wikimapia_Id":"14355196","Wikipedia_Url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parks_in_Jacksonville","city":"Jacksonville, Florida","imageName":"soccer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.59539185,28.0545378]},"properties":{"State":"Florida","Place":"Westchase","Address":" ","Name":"football field/archery range","Category":"Sports","subCategory":"Soccer","Image_Url":null,"Description":"","Wikimapia_Id":"22342981","Wikipedia_Url":null,"city":"","imageName":"soccer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.2916142,27.80288015]},"properties":{"State":"Florida","Place":"Boyette","Address":" ","Name":"Hillsborough County Soccer Fields","Category":"Sports","subCategory":"Soccer","Image_Url":null,"Description":"","Wikimapia_Id":"27565576","Wikipedia_Url":null,"city":"","imageName":"soccer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.7435943,27.89824435]},"properties":{"State":"Florida","Place":"Largo","Address":"1779 Belcher Road","Name":"Belcher Soccer Complex","Category":"Sports","subCategory":"Soccer","Image_Url":null,"Description":"Athletic Field\nBelcher Soccer Complex\n1779 Belcher Road\nLargo, Florida 33771\nwww.largoparks.com\n(727) 586-7415","Wikimapia_Id":"35445632","Wikipedia_Url":null,"city":"Largo, Florida","imageName":"soccer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.72555425,28.339826]},"properties":{"State":"Florida","Place":"Rockledge","Address":" ","Name":"Coach Skip Arrich Field","Category":"Sports","subCategory":"Soccer","Image_Url":null,"Description":"Soccer pitch dedicated to the first and only (through the 2008 season) soccer coach for the Rockledge High School Raiders.
